# ObjectDetectionCNN
by Jason Ligon and Daniel Kim
This was a project for my Artificial Neural Networks class.
It is an object detection system using an CNNs.
The CNNs were pre-trained using CIFAR-10 dataset and finally trained using Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) dataset to detect objects.

Datasets used:
MOTChallenge 2015: Towards a Benchmark for Multi-Target Tracking.
Laura Leal-Taix√©, Anton Milan, Ian Reid, Stefan Roth, Konrad Schindler.
